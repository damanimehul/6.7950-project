# Multi-Agent Sort (MA-Sort) 
This is the official codebase of MA-Sort, a MARL enviornment for comparison-based sorting. This work aims to replicate the emergence of dominance hierarchies in animal social groups when they compete for resources, resulting in the creation of a ranking system. 

## Setting up the codebase
Install conda environment using - 
```
conda env create -f requirements.yaml 
```
